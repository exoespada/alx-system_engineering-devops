# Learning Objectives

This repository contains information about the learning objectives for the project. The aim of this project is to help you gain a deeper understanding of various shell commands and concepts related to I/O redirection. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following topics without the need for external assistance:

1. Shell, I/O Redirection: Understand the concept of I/O redirection in shell scripting. Learn how to manipulate input and output streams in the command line environment.

3. Redirecting Standard Output: Learn how to redirect the output of a command to a file instead of displaying it on the terminal.

4. Redirecting Standard Input: Understand how to take input from a file rather than the keyboard for a command or program.

5. Piping: Discover how to send the output of one program or command as input to another program or command.
